# Insurance Game Refactoring

This document summarizes the structural changes implemented to improve the Insurance Game's architecture.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Domain Models Refactoring
- Extracted classes from `models.py` into separate model files in `data/models/`
  - `company.py`: Base insurance company class
  - `ai_competitor.py`: AI-controlled competitor class
  - `market_segment.py`: Market segment class for different insurance lines
  - `financial_report.py`: Financial reporting class

### 2. State Management
- Created a dedicated `state/` directory
- Implemented `game_state.py` as a standalone module for game state management

### 3. Service Layer
- Added a service-oriented architecture in `services/`
  - `game_service.py`: Core game flow orchestration service
  - `market_service.py`: Market dynamics and competition service

### 4. Modular UI Architecture
- Created a component-based UI system:
  - `ui/components/base_component.py`: Base class for all UI components
  - Enhanced existing components (Button, Panel, Slider)
  - Added proper type annotations and documentation
  
- Implemented a screen-based UI system:
  - `ui/screens/base_screen.py`: Base class for all screens
  - `ui/screens/main_menu_screen.py`: First screen implementation

- Added a screen manager for navigation:
  - `ui/screen_manager.py`: Manages navigation between screens

### 5. Application Entry Point
- Created `ui/game_application.py`: Main application class that integrates all components
- Added `main_new.py`: New entry point that runs alongside existing code

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, game logic, and data
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files with specific responsibilities
3. **Type Safety**: Enhanced type annotations for better IDE support and error detection
4. **Testability**: Decoupled components are easier to test in isolation
5. **Extensibility**: Easier to add new features through the plugin architecture
6. **Code Reuse**: Generic base classes reduce duplicate code

## Next Steps

1. Continue refactoring existing game logic into the service layer
2. Implement more screens using the new architecture
3. Complete the migration of UI components
4. Add proper event system to decouple components
5. Implement configuration system for game parameters
6. Begin adding unit tests for the new architecture

## Running the New Implementation

The new implementation can be run separately from the original codebase:

```
python main_new.py
```

This will launch the game with the new architecture without affecting the original implementation.
